# road-damage-detection-using-YOLO

 This repository contains the codes of my undergrad thesis work. Here I have built a total of 4 models using YOLO algorithms, that can detect road damages from a given image. The 4 models are -
- Binary Classification using YOLOv3
- Binary Classification using YOLOv4
- Multi-class Classification using YOLOv3
- Multi-class Classification using YOLOv4
   
All of these models have been implemented using the __DARKNET__ framework
